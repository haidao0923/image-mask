# Sil-Art
I created this project to learn about the very cool feature in CSS to generate an image mask. Pressing the "Generate" button automatically generate one of a predefined set of silhouettes in the category of "Nature", "Object", and "Animal", and also 4 corresponding images to be masked by the silhouettes.
